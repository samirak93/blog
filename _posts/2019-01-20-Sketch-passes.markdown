This is a idea in development, where user can sketch a single pass and find similar passes and their sequences.

**HOW TO:** User should select a team, enable the draw tool (Draw Tool) in the first pitch and then draw on the pitch. The pass sequences will be displayed in the second pitch. The sequences can be filtered, if there are multiple. The passes are from a old match between Watford and Liverpool. The timeline of passes will also be displayed at bottom.

**Note:** This is a work in progress and the next stage would be to sketch a sequence of passes and find similar passes.
