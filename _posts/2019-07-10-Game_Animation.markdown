An easy way to visualize player tracking data with animation. Built using [Bokeh Plots](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh), this tool can be used to visualise player movements for all sport. It also includes visualising voronoi and convex hulls, player speed and total distance covered by each player, interactively.
