I"*<p>This post looks at building an interactive tool, using python, to find out the end locations of crosses based on user input (cross start location). The user input gets the cross start location. Using that, the crosses nearby the start location are identified and their corresponding end locations are plotted on the graph. This uses a simple concept called¬†<b>cKDTree</b>, which uses¬†nearest-neighbor lookup concept.</p>

<p><b>Application:</b></p>

<p>When trying to create this interactive graph, I wanted to look at this from a coach/analyst perspective. Ideally, people would want to see where successful crosses <i>(crosses that either lead to a goal / shot at goal)</i> end up. These are usually represented by graphs similar to below.</p>

<p>But these images usually depict the entire dataset of crosses that are analysed. If filtered down further, they are usually  filtered down with respect to a particular player/team.</p>

<p>I wanted to narrow this same image to the point where these images are rendered based on user interactivity. 
So if the user clicks on a particular location on the pitch, the crosses nearest to it are collected and their corresponding end locations are shown. This is much more useful when user wants to visualise crosses only from certain locations rather than getting a complete view.</p>

<p>So the concept of <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.cKDTree.html">cKDTree</a> comes into picture here. It‚Äôs relatively simple to use.</p>

<p>The input here is the cross start location X and Y coordinates. One of the parameters we can manually provide is the search radius of the KDTree. In this case, the search radius given is 6 units.So the system find the nearest crosses around 6 units.</p>

<p><b>‚Äúpoint_tree.query_ball_point‚Äù</b> is the function to find the cross_end X and Y coordinates.</p>

<p>For coaches/analyst, this could be used to analyze the crossing patterns of teams from certain location and train teams to attack/defend from similar locations.</p>

<p>I tried to build this as a working demo (using python and d3js) but couldn‚Äôt come up with anything solid. If you can bring this as a demo online, I‚Äôd be delighted to get a look at it.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve any comments/issues on the post/code, please do let me know. I‚Äôm a beginner in python and please do expect potential flaws in the code :)</p>

<p>I‚Äôve built a tool using bokeh plot and hosted it on heroku.</p>

<p>The tool can be seen here.</p>
